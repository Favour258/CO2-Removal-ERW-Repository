# COâ‚‚ Removal from Enhanced Rock Weathering (ERW)

This project uses mock data to estimate and visualize carbon dioxide removal across five sites using enhanced rock weathering. It explores the relationship between soil pH, rainfall, basalt application, and COâ‚‚ capture rates.

## Features
- Data sorting and cleaning using Python (pandas)
- Visualizations using matplotlib
- Trend analysis and correlation
- Bubble plot with rainfall as size factor

ðŸ“Š Built as part of a PhD research support project in environmental systems science.
